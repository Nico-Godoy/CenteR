# CenteR
CenteR is a code designed for VLT/NACO data reduction using AGPM. It is based on a new centering technique using the images themselves for the detection of the AGPM in thermal emission, to later determine the position of the stars behind the coronagraph. In addition, it uses a new approach for frame selection based on the parameters obtained during centering and a decomposition based on pseudo-Zernike moments.
